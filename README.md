# randotuber
CLI tool to find a random youtuber

I'm by no means the best developer (in fact I'm using this as a way to learn C)

Things to do:
  - Set up access to YouTube api to fetch users
  - Integrate filters for last upload date, sub count min, etc...
  - Output results to file or direct links

Unplanned but possible features:
  - GUI
